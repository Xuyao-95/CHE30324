    "### The diatomic nitric oxide (NO) is an unusual and important molecule. It has an odd number of electrons, which is a rarity for stable molecule. It acts as a signaling molecule in the body, helping to regulate blood pressure, is a primary pollutant from combustion, and is a key constituent of smog. It exists in several isotopic forms, but the most common, ${}^{14}$N= ${}^{16}$O, has a bond length of 1.15077 Å and harmonic vibrational frequency of 1904 cm$^{-1}$."
