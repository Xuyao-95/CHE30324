    "### The electron wavefunctions(molecular orbitals) in molecules can be thought of as coming from linear combinations of atomic orbitals on the constituent atoms (in this context, the atomic orbitals are called ‚Äúbasis functions‚Äù). One of the factors that determines whether two atomic orbitals  form a molecular orbital is there ability to overlap. Consider two atoms, A and B, aligned on the z axis and separated by a distance $R$."

Calculate and plot out total molecular energy vs. bond distance in increments of 0.05 √Ö about your guessed minimum, including enough points to encompass the actual minimum.
